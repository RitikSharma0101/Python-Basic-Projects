# 📝 To-Do List App (Python)

A beginner-friendly console-based To-Do List application in Python.  
You can **add**, **view**, **remove**, and **clear** tasks — all stored in a simple text file that is created automatically.

---

## 📌 Features
- ➕ **Add Tasks** (multiple at once)  
- 📜 **View All Tasks** with numbering  
- ❌ **Remove a Task** by its number  
- 🗑 **Clear All Tasks** with confirmation  
- 💾 Tasks are saved in `data.txt` (created automatically when adding the first task)  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- File handling (`open`, read, write, append)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- String methods (`strip`, `join`)  
- Exception handling (`try`, `except`)  
- Python `match` statement  
- User input validation
