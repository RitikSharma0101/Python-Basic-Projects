# 🖨️ Pattern Printer

A beginner-friendly Python script that prints different text-based patterns. This project is great for learning loops, conditional logic, and string formatting in Python.

---

## 📌 Features

- Prints multiple types of patterns:
  - Right triangle
  - Inverted right triangle
  - Hollow triangle
  - Pyramid
- Allows easy customization of pattern size and symbols
- Clear, beginner-friendly code with comments

---

## 💻 How It Works

1. Takes user input for the pattern size (and optionally the symbol)  
2. Uses **nested `for` loops** to print patterns line by line  
3. Uses conditional checks to handle hollow and filled shapes  
4. Displays the selected pattern directly in the console

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- `for` loops & nested loops  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)  
- String multiplication & concatenation  
- Basic console input/output

## 🚀 Run the Script

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

```bash
python pattern_printer.py
```

Example output for a right triangle:
```
